# ESY Sunhome Client

Fetch daily energy data and battery state of charge from an ESY Sunhome
inverter through its authenticated API and MQTT connection.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When available, the client uses API tokens. If neither token is configured,
it falls back to the ESY account credentials:

```bash
export ESY_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
export ESY_REFRESH_TOKEN="..."
# Or:
export ESY_USERNAME="you@example.com"
export ESY_PASSWORD="your-password"
python fetch_today.py
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs daily at 00:00 UTC and can also be started
manually. Add `ESY_ACCESS_TOKEN` and/or `ESY_REFRESH_TOKEN` as repository
Actions secrets. If neither is set, configure both `ESY_USERNAME` and
`ESY_PASSWORD` secrets instead. The workflow writes the latest result to
`data/today.json` and commits it to `main` only when its contents change.

The JSON output contains daily PV generation, electricity bought from the
grid, electricity sold to the grid, total consumption, and battery SOC. An
MQTT-derived timestamp is included when the response header contains a valid
epoch timestamp.

MQTT credentials are read from device information. If unavailable, set
`ESY_MQTT_USERNAME` and `ESY_MQTT_PASSWORD`. Do not commit credentials,
certificates, or `.env` files.
